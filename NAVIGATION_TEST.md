# Navigation Test Guide

After fixing the Provider error, test the navigation functionality:

## **Test Steps:**

### **1. Test Sign Up Navigation**
1. Open the app
2. On the login screen, click **"Sign Up"** button
3. **Expected**: Should navigate to the signup screen
4. **If it works**: You'll see the signup form with name, email, password fields

### **2. Test Forgot Password Navigation**
1. On the login screen, click **"Forgot Password?"** link
2. **Expected**: Should navigate to the forgot password screen
3. **If it works**: You'll see a form to enter email for password reset

### **3. Test Back Navigation**
1. On signup screen, click the back arrow in the app bar
2. **Expected**: Should go back to login screen
3. **If it works**: You'll return to the login screen

### **4. Test Login Navigation**
1. On signup screen, click **"Login"** link at the bottom
2. **Expected**: Should navigate to login screen
3. **If it works**: You'll return to the login screen

## **What Was Fixed:**

The main issue was a **Provider error** in the router configuration:
- The router was trying to listen to AuthProvider changes from outside the widget tree
- This caused the app to crash when trying to navigate
- Fixed by changing `listen: true` to `listen: false` in the router redirect function

## **If Navigation Still Doesn't Work:**

1. **Clear browser cache** and reload the app
2. **Check browser console** (F12) for any remaining errors
3. **Try using the browser back/forward buttons** to test navigation
4. **Verify the app is running** without the Provider error

## **Expected Behavior:**

- ✅ **Sign Up button** → Navigate to signup screen
- ✅ **Forgot Password link** → Navigate to forgot password screen  
- ✅ **Back button** → Return to previous screen
- ✅ **Login link** → Return to login screen
- ✅ **No Provider errors** in console

The navigation should now work correctly after fixing the Provider configuration issue!
