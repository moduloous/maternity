# Signup Redirect Test Guide

## **Issue:**
After signup, the app shows "Creating your account..." but stays on the login page instead of redirecting to home.

## **What Was Fixed:**

### **1. Removed `refreshListenable` from Router**
- The `refreshListenable: Provider.of<AuthProvider>(context, listen: false)` was causing Provider errors
- This prevented the router from working properly

### **2. Removed Manual Navigation**
- Removed `context.go('/home')` from both login and signup screens
- Let the router's redirect logic handle navigation automatically

### **3. Added Debug Logging**
- Added print statements to track authentication state changes
- Added debug button to check current auth state

## **Test Steps:**

### **Step 1: Test Signup Flow**
1. **Run the app**: `flutter run -d chrome`
2. **Click "Sign Up"** on the login screen
3. **Fill out the form**:
   - Name: "Test User"
   - Email: "test@example.com"
   - Password: "password123"
   - Role: "Job Seeker"
4. **Click "Create Account"**
5. **Watch the console** for debug messages

### **Step 2: Check Console Output**
Look for these messages in the browser console (F12):
```
Signup successful - User: Test User, Authenticated: true
Forcing router refresh after signup
Router redirect - Location: /auth/signup, Authenticated: true, User: Test User
Redirecting to home - authenticated
```

### **Step 3: Test Debug Button**
1. **Click "Debug Auth State"** button on login screen
2. **Check console** for current authentication state
3. **Verify** that `isAuthenticated` is `true` after signup

### **Step 4: Test Login Flow**
1. **Sign out** (if you're on home screen)
2. **Try logging in** with the same credentials
3. **Check console** for similar debug messages

## **Expected Behavior:**

### **✅ Successful Signup:**
- Form submits successfully
- "Account created successfully! Redirecting to home..." message appears
- Console shows authentication success messages
- Router automatically redirects to home page
- User sees the home screen with job listings

### **❌ If Still Not Working:**
- Check console for error messages
- Verify Supabase database is set up correctly
- Check if user profile was created in the `users` table

## **Debug Information:**

### **Console Messages to Look For:**
```
Signup successful - User: [Name], Authenticated: true
Forcing router refresh after signup
Router redirect - Location: [path], Authenticated: [true/false], User: [name]
```

### **Common Issues:**
1. **Provider errors** - Should be fixed now
2. **Database connection** - Check Supabase credentials
3. **User profile creation** - Verify `users` table exists
4. **Router configuration** - Should work with new setup

## **If Still Not Working:**

1. **Clear browser cache** and reload
2. **Check Supabase dashboard** for user creation
3. **Verify database schema** is set up correctly
4. **Test with simple credentials** (test@test.com / password123)

The signup should now work correctly and automatically redirect to the home page!
